At Fakeco we employ people all around the world in hundreds of different countries. In order to successfully onboard someone, we need to collect information to make sure we are employing them compliantly. The information needed to employ someone differs by country. 

Clients can add new employees to our service by using our platform to submit their details. Your task is to create a form which changes based on the country an employee is being onboarded in and allows us to collect the needed information for that country.

There is some employee information that is needed for every country:

- Country of work
- First name
- Last name
- Date of birth
- Holiday allowance

There are three countries to handle for this task: Spain, Ghana and Brazil (these stats/figures are imaginary and for this exercise only)

Spain: 

- Extra fields:
    - Marital status
    - Social insurance number
- Minimum holiday allowance is 30 days

Ghana:

- Extra fields:
    - Marital status
    - Number of children
- No laws on holiday allowance

Brazil:

- Extra fields:
    - Working hours
- Maximum holiday allowance is 40 days

As there isn't currently a backend for this work, on form submit please log to the console the JSON you would normally send in a post request.

Every field present on the form should be mandatory and submission not allowed until each field is completed.

We aren't too worried about design but would like to see some styling if time permits.

Feel free to make any assumptions you see fit but please explain/clarify your thinking in the readme.
